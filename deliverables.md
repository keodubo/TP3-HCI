# Practical Project: Shopping List Manager
## Third Delivery: Mobile Interface Implementation

## Deliverables


### Mobile Application

A compressed file with ZIP or RAR extension must be submitted containing all necessary files to compile the application, along with the APK file needed to install it on an Android device without needing to use Android Studio.

**IMPORTANT:** The contents of the build folder present in the project should be omitted when generating the compressed file, as well as any other files that may have been generated for testing, frameworks that were ultimately not used, etc.

---

## Installation Instructions

The installation instructions must contain at minimum:

1. **Type of device (physical or emulator) and API Level versions used during testing.**
2. **Sequence of steps necessary to install and configure the application on a physical Android device.**

**NOTE:** The installation instructions do not necessarily need to be submitted separately and may be part of one of the report sections.
